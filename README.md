# WorldQuant-University-Data-Science-projects
I have successfully completed a 16-week and 8 end-to-end, applied data science projects of the Applied Data Science Lab module at WorldQuant University. The mini-projects included scientific computing, data wrangling, machine learning and natural language processing with Python.

The project highlights: 
1. HOUSING IN MEXICO: A dataset of 21,000 properties was used to determine if real estate prices are influenced more by property size or location. Imported and cleaned data from a CSV file, built data visualizations, and examined the relationship between two variables using correlation.


2. APARTMENT SALES IN BUENOS AIRES: Built a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Argentina. Created a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and then improved the model performance by reducing overfitting.


3. AIR QUALITY IN NAIROBI: Built an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Kenya, extracted data from a MongoDB database using pymongo, and improved model performance through hyperparameter tuning.


4. EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE IN NEPAL: Built logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings, extracted data from a SQLite database, and revealed the biases in the data that can lead to discrimination.


5. BANKRUPTCY IN POLAND: Built random forest and gradient boosting models to predict whether a company will go bankrupt, navigated the Linux command line, addressed imbalanced data through resampling, and considered the impact of performance metrics precision and recall.


6. CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION IN THE US: Built a k-means model to cluster US consumers into groups, used principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization, and then created an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.


7. A/B TESTING AT WORLDQUANT UNIVERSITY: Conducted a chi-square test to determine if sending an email can increase program enrollment at WQU, built custom Python classes to implement an ETL process, and created an interactive data application following a three-tiered design pattern.


8. VOLATILITY FORECASTING IN INDIA: Created a GARCH time series model to predict asset volatility, acquired stock data through an API, cleaned and stored it in a SQLite database, and then built an API to serve model predictions.
